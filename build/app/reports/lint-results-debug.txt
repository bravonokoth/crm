/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:49: Warning: <uses-permission> tag appears after <application> tag [ManifestOrder]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml:58: Warning: <uses-permission> tag appears after <application> tag [ManifestOrder]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ManifestOrder":
   The <application> tag should appear after the elements which declare which
   version you need, which features you need, which libraries you need, and so
   on. In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting
   applied correctly) when the <application> tag appears before some of these
   other elements, so it's best to order your manifest in the logical
   dependency order.

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/build.gradle:78: Warning: A newer version of com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth than 20.6.0 is available: 21.3.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:20.6.0'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-v21: Warning: This folder configuration (v21) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 21. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png: Warning: The resource R.mipmap.ic_launcher appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/sales_navigator.png: Warning: The resource R.drawable.sales_navigator appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/sales_navigator.png: Warning: The resource R.mipmap.sales_navigator appears to be unused [UnusedResources]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]
/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]
/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]
/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]
/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://material.io/design/iconography/) your launcher icons should "use a
   distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional, front view, with a slight
   perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: The image ic_launcher_round.png varies significantly in its density-independent (dip) size across the various density versions: mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 131x99 dp (196x148 px), mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 196x148 dp (196x148 px), mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 98x74 dp (196x148 px), mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 65x49 dp (196x148 px), mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: 49x37 dp (196x148 px) [IconDipSize]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png: Warning: The ic_launcher_round.png icon has identical contents in the following configuration folders: mipmap-hdpi, mipmap-mdpi, mipmap-xhdpi, mipmap-xxhdpi, mipmap-xxxhdpi [IconDuplicatesConfig]
/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/sales_navigator.png: Warning: The sales_navigator.png icon has identical contents in the following configuration folders: drawable-v21, drawable, mipmap-xxxhdpi [IconDuplicatesConfig]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicatesConfig":
   If an icon is provided under different configuration parameters such as
   drawable-hdpi or -v11, they should typically be different. This detector
   catches cases where the same icon is provided in different configuration
   folder which is usually not intentional.

/home/bravon/Desktop/crm/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/sales_navigator.png: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/sales_navigator.png in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.
